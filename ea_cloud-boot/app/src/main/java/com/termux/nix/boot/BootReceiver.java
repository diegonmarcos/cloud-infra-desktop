/**
 * Runs one command inside Nix-on-Droid at device boot.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A FORK OF termux-boot
 * -------------------------------------
 * Termux:Boot declares android:sharedUserId="com.termux", so it executes as the
 * same uid as the Termux app. That single fact buys it two things we cannot have:
 *
 *   1. It can listFiles() the boot directory, which is 0700 and owned by the
 *      app uid.
 *   2. It can start TermuxService, which is android:exported="false" and so is
 *      reachable only from inside the app's own uid.
 *
 * Android grants a shared uid only to apps signed with the SAME certificate.
 * Nix-on-Droid is signed by F-Droid; we do not hold that key and cannot obtain
 * it, so this app can never share com.termux.nix's uid. A forked termux-boot
 * would fail to install (INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE), and if it
 * somehow installed it could do neither (1) nor (2).
 *
 * THE DOOR THAT IS ACTUALLY OPEN
 * ------------------------------
 * RunCommandService is android:exported="true", guarded by a RUN_COMMAND
 * permission declared protectionLevel="dangerous" rather than "signature". A
 * foreign-signed app may hold a dangerous permission with user consent, so this
 * path is reachable. The host additionally requires allow-external-apps=true in
 * termux.properties; that file is deployed declaratively by the Nix flake.
 *
 * CONSEQUENCE FOR THE DESIGN
 * --------------------------
 * We still cannot enumerate the 0700 boot directory, so this app does not try.
 * It launches ONE fixed script, and that script — running as the host uid —
 * does the enumeration. So the boot-script set is data on the device, not code
 * in this APK: adding or changing scripts never requires rebuilding it.
