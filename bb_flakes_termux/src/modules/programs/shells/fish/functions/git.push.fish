# git.push — sync-then-push in ONE command, no stale ref, no second push.
#
# A pre-push hook cannot do this: git compare-and-swaps refs/heads/<branch>
# against the sha it read BEFORE the hook ran, so if the hook's rebase moves
# HEAD the in-flight push is doomed no matter what the hook does (verified
# 2026-08-09). The fix is to run the sync engine BEFORE git resolves the refs
# to push at all — this function does exactly that, in `ask` mode, which
# already fetches, rebases and pushes (step 4), so it's a complete push.
