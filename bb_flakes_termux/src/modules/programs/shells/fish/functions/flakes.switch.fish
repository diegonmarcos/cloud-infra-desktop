#   1. git sync local   inside ~/git/cloud-unix  (LOCAL wins on conflict, and the
#      engine pushes your own commits too — it is bidirectional)
#   2. bb_flakes_termux/build.sh switch
#
# Renamed from `up` (2026-08-08): `up` was a flake.nix sharedAliases entry
# that shadowed the managed function for months, and the name said nothing
# about what it did. The dotted name is a namespace, not syntax — fish
# accepts any function name without a slash.
#
# ONE implementation: the `sw` binary (src/scripts/sw.sh) does exactly these
# two steps and is on PATH for bash/zsh/cron too. This function is the
# fish-facing name for it, so every shell runs the same code.
